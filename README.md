when i was  
a young boy  
my father  
took me into the city  
to see a marching band  
he said, "son, when  
you grow up  
would you be  
the savior of the broken  
the beaten and the damned?"  
he said, "will you   
defeat them?  
your demons,   
and all the non-believers  
the plans that they have made?"  
"because one day,   
i'll leave you  
a phantom  
to lead you in the summer  
to join the black parade"  
when i was  
a young boy  
my father   
took me into the city

you grow up  
would you be  
the savior of the broken  
the beaten and the damned?"  
sometimes i get the feelin'  
she's watchin' over me  
and other times i feel like i should go  
and through it all, the rise and fall  
the bodies in the streets  
and when you're gone, we want you all to know  
we'll carry on,  
we'll carry on  
and though you're dead and gone, believe me  
your memory will carry on  
we'll carry on  
and in my heart, i can't contain it  
the anthem won't explain it  
a world that sends you reelin'  
from decimated dreams  
your misery and hate will kill us all  
so paint it black and take it back  
let's shout it loud and clear  
defiant to the end, we hear the call  
to carry on,  
we'll carry on  
and though you're dead and gone, believe me  
your memory will carry on  
we'll carry on  
and though you're broken and defeated  
your weary widow marches  
on and on, we carry through the fears  
oh, ah, ha  
disappointed faces of your peers  
oh, ah, ha  
take a look at me, 'cause i could not care at all  
do or die, you'll never make me  
because the world will never take my heart  
go and try, you'll never break me  
we want it all, we wanna play this part  
i won't explain or say i'm sorry  
i'm unashamed, i'm gonna show my scars  
give a cheer for all the broken  
listen here, because it's who we are  
just a man, i'm not a hero  
just a boy, who had to sing this song  
just a man, i'm not a hero  
i don't care  
we'll carry on, we'll carry on  
and though you're dead and gone, believe me  
your memory will carry on  
you'll carry on  
and though you're broken and defeated  
your weary widow marches, oh  
do or die, you'll never make me  
because the world will never take my heart  
go and try, you'll never break me  
we want it all, we wanna play this part (we'll carry on)  
do or die, you'll never make me (we'll carry on)  
because the world will never take my heart (we'll carry on)
