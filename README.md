when i was  
a young boy  
my father  
took me into the city  
to see a marching band  
he said, "son, when  
you grow up  
would you be  
the savior of the broken  
the beaten and the damned?"  
he said, "will you   
defeat them?  
your demons,   
and all the non-believers  
the plans that they have made?"  
"because one day,   
i'll leave you  
a phantom  
to lead you in the summer  
to join the black parade"  
when i was  
a young boy  
my father   
took me into the city
